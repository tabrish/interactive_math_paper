Welcome! We are building a python script to convert latex files to html, with the goal of adding features to make math papers easier and more fun to read. The main features we have at the moment are: 
 - proofs are collapsible/click-to-expand
 - if a word is defined, hovering over that word anywhere in the paper displays the definition  
 - if a theorem/lemma/etc is referenced later in a paper, hovering over “Theorem X” displays the statement of Theorem X
