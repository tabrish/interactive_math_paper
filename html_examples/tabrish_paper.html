    A \em  separation of a graph  $G$  is a partition  $(A_1, A_2, C)$  of  $V(G)$  such that  $A_1$  is anticomplete to  $A_2$ . A classic result from Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Project states that there is a correspondence between tree decompositions and laminar collections of separations. A \em  many-sided separation of a graph  $G$  is a partition  $(A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$  of  $V(G)$  such that  $A_i$  is anticomplete to  $A_j$  for all  $1 \leq  i < j \leq  k$ . In this note, we show a correspondence between tree decompositions with a certain parity property, called \em  deciduous tree decompositions, and laminar collections of many-sided separations. 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
A \em  tree decomposition $(T, \chi )$  of a graph  $G$  consists of a tree  $T$  and a map  $\chi : V(T) \to  2^V(G)$ , satisfying the following properties: 
\hspace{1.5em} (i)\item For every $v \in V(G)$, there exists $t \in V(T)$ such that $v \in \chi(t)$, 
     \item For every $v_1v_2 \in E(G)$, there exists $t \in V(T)$ such that $v_1, v_2 \in \chi(t)$, 
     \item For every $v \in V(G)$, the support of $v$ in $(T, \chi)$ is connected. 
 
The \em  width of a tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$  is  $\min _t \in  V(T) |\chi (t)| - 1$ . The \em  treewidth of a graph  $G$  is the minimum width of a tree decomposition of  $G$ . The sets  $\chi (t)$  for  $t \in  V(T)$  are called the \em  bags of the tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$ . For a set  $X \subseteq  V(T)$ , we let  $\chi (X) = \bigcup _t \in  X\chi (t)$ . <hr>Let  $G$  be a graph and let  $X, Y \subseteq  V(G)$ . We say \em  $X$  is anticomplete to  $Y$  if no edge of  $G$  has one end in  $X$  and one end in  $Y$ . A \em  separation of  $G$  is a triple  $(A_1, A_2, C)$  such that: 1)  $(A_1, A_2, C)$  is a partition of  $V(G)$ , i.e.  $A_1, A_2, C \subseteq  V(G)$ ,  $A_1, A_2, C$  are pairwise disjoint, and  $A_1 \cup  A_2 \cup  C = V(G)$ ; and 2)  $A_1$  is anticomplete to  $A_2$ . Two separations  $(A_1, A_2, C)$  and  $(B_1, B_2, D)$  are \em  non-crossing if there exist  $1 \leq  i, j \leq  2$  such that  $A_3-i\cup  C \subseteq  B_j\cup  D$  and  $B_3-j\cup  D \subseteq  A_i \cup  C$ . <hr>Let  $G$  be a graph and let  $(T, \chi )$  be a tree decomposition of  $G$ . Let  $e = t_1t_2$  be an edge of  $E(T)$  and let  $T_1, T_2$  be the connected components of  $T \setminus e$  containing  $t_1$  and  $t_2$ , respectively. Then, up to symmetry between  $t_1$  and  $t_2$ , the \em  separation corresponding to  $e$ , denoted  $S_e = (A_1^e, A_2^e, C^e)$ , is defined as follows:  $C^e = \chi (t_1) \cap \chi (t_2)$ ,  $A_1^e = \chi (T_1) \setminus  C^e$ , and  $A_2^e = \chi (T_2) \setminus  C^e$ . The collection of separations corresponding to  $(T, \chi )$ , denoted  $\tau ((T, \chi ))$  is defined as follows:  $\tau ((T, \chi )) =S_e \mid  e \in  E(T)$ . <hr>A collection  $\S $  of separations of  $G$  is called \em  laminar if the separations of  $\S $  are pairwise non-crossing. The following result of Robertson and Seymour states that there is a correspondence between tree decompositions of  $G$  and laminar collections of separations of  $G$ . <hr><div class="theorem">
            <span class="theorem-label">Theorem.</span> \cite{GMX} \label{thm:RS} 
Let  $G$  be a graph. Then, for every tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$  of  $G$ ,  $\tau ((T, \chi ))$  is laminar. Conversely, for every laminar collection of separations  $S$  of  $G$ , there exists a tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$  of  $G$  such that  $\tau ((T, \chi )) = S$ .  

        </div>
In this note, we show that a similar correspondence exists for generalizations of separations called many-sided separations. 

A \em  many-sided separation of  $G$  is a tuple  $(A_1, A_2, \hdots , A_k, C)$ , with  $k \geq  2$ , such that: <hr>\hspace{1.5em} (i)\item $A_1, A_2, \hdots, A_k, C \subseteq V(G)$,
     \item $A_1, A_2, \hdots, A_k, C$ are pairwise disjoint, 
     \item $A_1 \cup \hdots \cup A_k \cup C = V(G)$, and
     \item for all $1 \leq i < j \leq k$, $A_i$ is anticomplete to $A_j$. 
 
Many-sided separations offer a way to store more precise structural information than standard separations. To see this, consider the following example. Let  $G$  be a connected graph and let  $C \subseteq  V(G)$  be such that  $G \setminus  C$  has  $k$  connected components  $A_1, \hdots , A_k$ . The many-sided separation given by  $(A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$  includes each of the connected components of  $G \setminus  C$ , thus storing full information about the structure of  $G \setminus  C$ . This can also be represented by a standard separation as follows: choose  $\emptyset \subsetneq  I \subset 1, \hdots , k$ , let  $A_1' = \bigcup _i \in  I A_i$ , and let  $A_2' = \bigcup _j \in 1, \hdots , k\setminus  I A_j$ . Now,  $(A_1', A_2', C)$  is a standard separation containing information about  $G \setminus  C$ . Note that while the many-sided separation  $(A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$  is unique (up to symmetry between the order of the components), there are  $2^k-1 - 1$  possibilities for the standard separation  $(A_1', A_2', C)$ (up to symmetry between  $A_1'$  and  $A_2'$ ). Further, each  $A_i$  is connected in the many-sided separation  $(A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$ , but no choice of  $I$  allows for both  $A_1'$  and  $A_2'$  to be connected in the standard separation  $(A_1', A_2', C)$ . <hr>Separations are particularly powerful due to their relationship with deep structural concepts such as tree decompositions. In this paper, we show that there is a natural connection between many-sided separations and certain tree decompositions, extending the idea of Theorem \ref{thm:RS}  to many-sided separations.  <hr>
<h2>Many-sided separations</h2>
We begin this section with some definitions related to many-sided separations. Two many-sided separations  $(A_1, A_2, \hdots , A_k, C)$  and  $(B_1, B_2, \hdots , B_\ell , D)$  are \em  non-crossing if there exist  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$  and  $1 \leq  j \leq \ell $ , such that 
\item $\left(\bigcup_{1 \leq p \leq \ell} B_p \setminus B_j\right) \cup D \subseteq A_i \cup C$, and 
 \item $\left(\bigcup_{1 \leq p \leq k} A_p \setminus A_i\right) \cup C \subseteq B_j \cup D$. 
 
Notice that when  $k = \ell  = 2$ , the definition of non-crossing for many-sided separations is the same as the definition of non-crossing for separations. A collection  $\S $  of many-sided separations is called \em  laminar if the many-sided separations of  $\S $  are pairwise non-crossing. <hr>We say that a tree  $T$  is \em  deciduous if for every two leaves  $\ell _1, \ell _2$  of  $T$ , the path from  $\ell _1$  to  $\ell _2$  in  $T$  has even length. A tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$  of a graph  $G$  is \em  deciduous if  $T$  is deciduous. Let  $G$  be a graph and let  $(T, \chi )$  be a deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$ . Let  $(X, Y)$  be a bipartition of  $V(T)$  and assume up to symmetry that every leaf of  $T$  is in  $Y$ . For  $x \in  X$ , the \em  many-sided separation corresponding to  $x$ , denoted  $S_x = (A_1^x, \hdots , A_\text{deg} (x)^x, C)$ , is defined as follows. Let  $\deg (x) = k$  and let  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$  be the neighbors of  $x$  in  $T$ . Let  $T_1, \hdots , T_k$  be the components of  $T \setminus t$  containing  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$ , respectively. Then,  $C^x = \chi (t)$ , and for  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$ ,  $A_i^x = \chi (T_i) \setminus \chi (t)$ . Now, the collection of many-sided separations corresponding to  $(T, \chi )$ , denoted  $\tau ^*((T, \chi ))$ , is defined as follows:  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = S_x \mid  x \in  X$ . <hr>The goal of the next two theorem is to prove a result similar to Theorem \ref{thm:RS}  for many-sided separations and deciduous tree decompositions.

Let  $G$  be a graph and let  $\S $  be a laminar collection of many-sided separations of  $G$ . Then, there exists a deciduous tree decomposition  $(T, \chi )$  of  $G$  such that  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \S $ .

We proceed by induction on  $|\S |$ . Suppose  $|\S | = 1$  and let  $\S  = S$ , where  $S = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$ . Let  $T = K_1, k$  with vertex  $u$  of degree  $k$  and vertices  $v_1, \hdots , v_k$  adjacent to  $u$ , and let  $\chi : V(T) \to  2^V(G)$  be defined as follows:  $\chi (u) = C$  and  $\chi (v_i) = A_i \cup  C$  for  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$ . It is easy to verify that  $(T, \chi )$  is a deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$  and that  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \S $ . <hr>Now, suppose the statement holds for all collections  $\S '$  with  $|\S '| = n-1$ , and consider a collection  $\S $  with  $|\S | = n$ . Let  $\S  = S_1, \hdots , S_n$ . Since  $\S $  is laminar, there exists  $S = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C) \in \S $  and  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$  such that for all  $S' = (A_1', \hdots , A_k'', C
) \in \S \setminus S$ , there exists  $1 \leq  j \leq  k'$  with  $\left( \bigcup _1 \leq  p \leq  k' A_p' \setminus  A_j \right) \cup  C' \subseteq  A_i \cup  C$ . Let  $S^* \in \S $  be such that the set  $A_j' \cup  C'$  with this property is maximal. <hr>
Let  $\S ' = \S \setminus S$ . Let  $(T', \chi ')$  be a deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$  such that  $\tau ^*((T', \chi ')) = \S '$ . Let  $(X', Y')$  be a bipartition of  $V(T')$  such that all the leaves of  $T$  are in  $Y$ , let  $x^* \in  V(T')$  be such that  $S_x^* = S^*$ , and let  $j$  be the neighbor of  $x^*$  in  $T$  such that if  $T_j$  is the subtree of  $T \setminus x^*$  containing  $j$ , then  $\chi (T_j) \setminus \chi (x^*) = A_j'$ . We create tree  $T$  from  $T'$  as follows: add vertex  $x$  adjacent to  $j$ , and add vertices  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$  adjacent to  $x$  for  $1 \leq  p \neq  i \leq  k$ . We create  $\chi $  from  $\chi '$  as follows:  $\chi (v) = \chi '(v)$  for all  $v \in  V(T')$ ,  $\chi (x) = C$ , and  $\chi (y_p) = A_p \cup  C$  for all  $1 \leq  p \neq  i \leq  k$ . Now, it is easy to verify that  $(T, \chi )$  is a deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$  with  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \S $ .

Let  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$  be the neighbors of  $x_1$  in  $T$ , and let  $T_1, \hdots , T_k$  be the components of  $T \setminus x_1$  containing  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$ , respectively.

By symmetry, it also holds that for all  $1 \leq  p \leq  k$  with  $p \neq  i$ ,  $A_p \cup  C \subseteq  A_j' \cup  C'$ . Therefore,  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  are non-crossing. This completes the proof of the lemma.

In this section, we consider the following question. Let  $G$  be a graph, let  $\mathcal{S} ^*$  be a laminar collection of many-sided separations of  $G$ , and let  $(T, \chi )$  be a deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$  such that  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \mathcal{S} ^*$ (as in Theorem \ref{thm:S-to-TD} ). Since  $(T, \chi )$  is a tree decomposition of  $G$ , it holds by Theorem \ref{thm:RS}  that there is a laminar collection of (standard) separations  $\mathcal{S} $  such that  $\tau ((T, \chi )) = \mathcal{S} $ . What is the relationship between  $\mathcal{S} ^*$  and  $\mathcal{S} $ ?  <hr>
Let  $S = (A_1, A_2, \hdots , A_k, C)$  be a many-sided separation of a graph  $G$ . The \em  separation projection $\rho (S)$  of  $S$  is a collection of  $k$  separations defined as follows:  $$\rho (S) = (A_i, \bigcup _1 \leq  j \neq  i \leq  k A_j, C) \mid  1 \leq  i \leq  k.$$  Let  $\S $  be a laminar collection of many-sided separations. The \em  separation projection  $\rho (\S )$  of the collection  $\S $  is defined as follows: 
 $$\rho (\S ) = \bigcup _S \in \S \rho (S).$$ <div class="theorem">

Let  $G$  be a graph, let  $\S $  be a laminar collection of many-sided separations of  $G$ , and let  $\rho (\S )$  be the separation projection of  $\S $ . Then,  $\rho (\S )$  is laminar.

            <summary>Proof</summary>
            <div class="proof-content">
First, we show that  $\rho (S)$  is laminar for  $S \in \S $ . Let  $S = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$  and let  $S_1, S_2 \in \rho (S)$ , with  $S_1 = (A_1, \bigcup _2 \leq  i \leq  k A_i, C)$  and  $S_2 = (A_2, \bigcup _1 \leq  i \neq  2 \leq  k A_i, C)$ . Then,  $A_2 \cup  C \subseteq \left( \bigcup _2 \leq  i \leq  k A_i\right) \cup  C$  and  $A_1 \cup  C \subseteq \left( \bigcup _1 \leq  i \neq  2 \leq  k A_i\right) \cup  C$ , so it follows that  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  are non-crossing. Therefore,  $\rho (S)$  is laminar. <hr>Now, let  $S, S' \in \S $  with  $S = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$  and  $S' = (B_1, \hdots , B_\ell , D)$ . Since  $\S $  is laminar, it holds that  $S, S'$  are non-crossing; let  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$  and  $1 \leq  j \leq \ell $  be such that  $\left( \bigcup _1 \leq  p \leq \ell  B_p \setminus  B_j\right) \cup  D \subseteq  A_i \cup  C$ , and   $\left( \bigcup _1 \leq  p \leq  k A_p \setminus  A_i\right) \cup  C \subseteq  B_j \cup  D$ . Let  $S_1 = (A_1, \bigcup _2 \leq  p \leq  k A_p, C)$  and let  $S_2 = (B_1, \bigcup _2 \leq  p \leq \ell  B_p, D)$ . There are four cases. 
\item If $i \neq 1$, $j \neq 1$, then it follows that $A_1 \cup C \subseteq \bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq \ell} B_p \cup D$ and $B_1 \cup D \subseteq \bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq k} A_p \cup C$, so $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-crossing. 

 \item If $i \neq 1$, $j = 1$, then it follows that $A_1 \cup C \subseteq B_1 \cup D$ and $\bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq \ell} B_p \cup D \subseteq \bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq k} A_p \cup C$, so $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-crossing. 

 \item If $i =1$, $j \neq 1$, then it follows that $\bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq k} A_p \cup D \subseteq \bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq \ell} B_p \cup C$ and $B_1 \cup D \subseteq A_1 \cup C$, so $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-crossing. 

 \item Finally, if $i=1, j=1$, it follows that $\bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq k} A_p \cup C \subseteq B_1 \cup D$ and $\bigcup_{2 \leq p \leq \ell} B_p \cup D \subseteq A_1 \cup C$, so $S_1$ and $S_2$ are non-crossing. 
  
We have shown that for all  $S_1, S_2 \in \rho (\S )$ ,  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  are non-crossing, so  $\rho (\S )$  is laminar.

A cutset  $C$  is \em  minimal if for all  $C' \subset  C$ , it holds that  $G \setminus  C'$  is connected. The following easy lemma states a property of minimal cutsets.<hr><div class="theorem">

Let  $G$  be a connected graph and let  $C$  be a minimal cutset of  $G$ . Let  $A_1, \hdots , A_k$  be the connected components of  $G \setminus  C$ , and let  $c \in  C$ . Then,  $c$  has a neighbor in  $A_i$  for all  $1 \leq  i \leq  k$ .

Suppose that  $c$  has no neighbor in  $A_j$  for some  $1 \leq  j \leq  k$ . Let  $C' = C \setminus c$  and consider  $G \setminus  C'$ .  Since  $A_j$  is a connected component of  $G \setminus  C$ , it follows that  $A_j$  is anticomplete to  $G \setminus  C$ . Further,  $c$  has no neighbor in  $A_j$ , it follows that  $A_j$  is anticomplete to  $G \setminus  C'$ . Therefore,  $A_j$  is a connected component of  $G \setminus  C'$ . Since  $A_j \neq  V(G) \setminus  C'$ , it follows that  $G \setminus  C'$  is not connected, contradicting that  $C$  is a minimal cutset of  $G$ . This completes the proof.

Let  $G$  be a connected graph and let  $\S $  be a laminar collection of many-sided separations of  $G$ . Suppose that for every  $S \in \S $  with  $S = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$ , it holds that  $C$  is a minimal cutset of  $G$  and  $A_1, \hdots , A_k$  are the connected components of  $G \setminus  C$ . Let  $(T, \chi )$  be the deciduous tree decomposition of  $G$  such that  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \S $ . Then,  $\tau ((T, \chi )) = \rho (\S )$ .

Let  $(X, Y)$  be a bipartition of  $T$  and let  $Y$  be the partite set containing the leaves of  $T$ . Then, every edge of  $T$  is of the form  $xy$  for  $x \in  X$ ,  $y \in  Y$ . Let  $x \in  X$  and let  $y_1, \hdots , y_k$  be the neighbors of  $x$  in  $T$ , and let  $S_x = (A_1, \hdots , A_k, C)$ . <hr>\sta{\label{step-1} $\{S_{xy_i} \mid 1 \leq i \leq k\} = \rho(S_x)$.} 
Let  $e = xy_i$  and let  $T_1$ ,  $T_2$  be the components of  $T \setminus e$  containing  $x$  and  $y_i$ , respectively. Then,  $C^e = \chi (x) \cap \chi (y_i)$ ,  $A_1^e = \chi (T_1) \setminus  C^e$ , and  $A_2^e = \chi (T_2) \setminus  C^e$ . Since  $\tau ^*((T, \chi )) = \mathcal{S} $ , it holds that  $\chi (x) = C$ . Let  $c \in  C$ . Since  $C$  is a minimal cutset, it follows that there exists  $a \in  A_i = \chi (T_2) \setminus \chi (x)$  such that  $ac$  is an edge of  $G$ . By the definition of tree decomposition, there exists  $t \in  V(T)$  such that  $a, c\subseteq \chi (t)$ . Since  $a \in \chi (T_2) \setminus \chi (x)$ , it holds that  $t \in  V(T_2)$ . Therefore,  $c \in \chi (T_2)$ , and thus  $c \in \chi (y_i)$ . It follows that  $\chi (x) \subseteq \chi (y_i)$ , and so  $C^e = C$ . Now,  $S_e = (A_i, \bigcup _1\leq  j \neq  i \leq  k A_j, C)$ , and so  $S_xy_i\mid  1 \leq  i \leq  k = \rho (S_x)$ . This proves \eqref{step-1} .
For every  $x \in  X$ , let  $\S _x = S_xy_i\mid  y_i \in  N(x)$ . Since every edge of  $T$  is incident with a vertex in  $X$ , it follows that  $\bigcup _x \in  X\S _x = \tau ((T, \chi ))$ . By \eqref{step-1} , it follows that  $\bigcup _x \in  X\S _x = \bigcup _S \in \S \rho (S) = \rho (\S )$ . Therefore,  $\tau ((T, \chi )) = \rho (S)$ .
